# About

This software is designed to detect objects under a microscope with darkfield objectives automatically. Jiri Zelenka and Dominik Kriegner created it for the Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences. The software is optimized for Python 3.11.4 in MS Windows.

# How it works

The software is developed as a terminal and graphical application. A user can take a photo or choose an existing photo. It processes the photo and creates a catalogue in an Excel table. The catalogue contains each sample's ID, size, coordinates and photo.

# Installation

It is available as a GUI and terminal version for MS Windows at [GitHub](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/html/jekyll). There are non-installable exe-files.

There is also a multi-system Python version. The manual of installation is [here](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages).
